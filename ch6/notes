                                  Value Methods

All the methods we have written so far have been void; that is, they dont return
values. In this chapter, we'll write methods that return values, which we call
value methods.


6.1: Return values

  Compared to void methods, value methods differ in two ways:
    1. They declare the type of the return value (called the return type)
    2. They use at least one return statement to provide a return value

    Note that if you put return statements inside a conditional statement, you
    have to make sure that every possible path through the program reaches a return statement.


  6.2: Incremental Development

    Incremental development is a software development process in which:
      1. Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes. At
        any point, if there is an error, you will know where to look.
      2. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can check them with print statements
      3. Once the program is working, you can consolidate multiple statements into
        compound expressions

  6.3: Method composition

    Functional decomposition: breaking a complex computation into simple methods,
      testing the methods in isolation, and then composing the methods to perform
      the computation
